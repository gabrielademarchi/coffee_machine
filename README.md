# Coffee Machine

This virtual coffee machine serves 3 hot flavours, **espresso, latte and cappuccino**. Each of them requires a different quantity of water, 
a different quantity of coffee and a different quantity of milk. Also, each has different price.
Our machine is able to:
1) print a report of how much resources it's left, by typing *'report'*; 
2) check if the resources are sufficient when the user orders a drink;
3) process different coins as payment (*quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies*) and return the user's change; 
4) check if the trasaction was successful, in which case it's going to make the coffee â˜•, deducting the resources of it's stock accordingly.
5) Lastly,the 'operator' can turn the machine off (stop running the program) by typing *'off'* or restock the **water, milk and coffee** contents to it's maximum again by typing *'restock'*.
